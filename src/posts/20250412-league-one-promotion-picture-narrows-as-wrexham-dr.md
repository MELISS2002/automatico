Wrexham's automatic promotion hopes took a hit on Saturday as they played out a goalless draw with Wigan Athletic, while third-placed Wycombe Wanderers' dramatic late victory over Stevenage moved them within a point of the Welsh club.
In better news for Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds' side, the point earned at the Brick Community Stadium assures the Welsh club of at least a spot in the League One playoffs.
Their draw also handed the League One title to Birmingham City.
The top two teams will clinch a spot in the second tier of English football next season, while those who finish from third to sixth place will battle it out for the last remaining promotion place.
Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson named an unchanged side for the sixth game in a row, with James McLean captaining the Red Dragons against his former side. After a first half lacking in clear-cut chances, Wrexham midfielder George Dobson threatened to break the deadlock shortly before the interval but his half-volley whistled wide of the post.
Diaster almost struck in the 64th minute when Wigan forward Maleace Asamoah forced Wrexham goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo into a smart stop.
Wigan wasted another chance to get themselves in front when Owen Dale failed to finish off a well-worked passing move as he shot straight at Okonkwo.
Despite the introduction of Steven Fletcher, Ryan Barnett and Elliot Lee midway through the half, Wrexham continued to struggle for creativity and were made to settle for a point from their trip to Greater Manchester.
