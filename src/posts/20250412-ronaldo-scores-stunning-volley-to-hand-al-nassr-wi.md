Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice, including a stunning volleyed effort, to give Al Nassr a come-from-behind win over the visiting Al Riyadh in the Saudi Pro League on Saturday.
After Faïz Selemani had given Al Riyadh the lead in first-half stoppage time, Ronaldo struck twice in eight minutes in the second half to grab the three points for his side.
His first goal arrived in the 56th minute, with the Portugal forward finishing into an open net from close range after a well-worked free-kick routine allowed Sadio Mané to find him wide open in the 6-yard box.
It was the 40-year-old's second goal that really caught the eye, however. After a cross was cleared to the edge of the box, Ronaldo met the ball with a first-time unstoppable volley into the top corner of the goal.
Ronaldo now has four goals in his last two games, following his double against Al Hilal last week, after what was his sixth multigoal game of the season.
Ronaldo, who has scored in five successive matches, almost turned provider for Jhon Duran in stoppage time, squaring the ball for the Colombian striker, but his shot flew over the crossbar.
The miss almost proved costly as Al-Riyadh substitute Enes Sali rattled the post with a curling effort moments later, but Al Nassr held on for their 17th win of the league season.
Al Nassr are third on the table, one point behind second-placed Al Hilal and eight behind leaders Al Ittihad.
