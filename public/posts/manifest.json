        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "MILAN -- United States midfielder Weston McKennie is among 13 soccer players being investigated for illegal online betting in Italy, according to widespread media reports.\nA new investigation by Milan prosecutors stems from evidence given by Sandro Tonali and Nicolo Fagioli in 2023. Both then served lengthy bans, ruling them out for most of last season, after agreeing to plea bargains that also included therapy for a gambling addiction.\nJuventus midfielder Fagioli -- currently on loan at Fiorentina -- was banned for seven months after admitting to betting on matches, while Newcastle's Tonali received a longer suspension of 10 months as his bets also included his team's games -- at the time AC Milan.\nThe duo are also named in the new investigation, along with Fagioli's then-Juventus teammate McKennie and nine other current or former Serie A players, as well as Leeds defender Junior Firpo.\nThere is no evidence that the other players ever gambled on soccer matches but their names emerged from depositions given by Tonali and Fagioli and analysis of their devices.\nThe players are being investigated for using illegal platforms for online poker and betting on other sports. As such they do not risk a ban but instead a maximum fine of 250 euros ($284) from Italian authorities.\nTonali and Fagioli have also been accused of promoting those sites among their teammates and other soccer players.\nFagioli said in a deposition: \"I pointed out to [former Aston Villa forward Nicolò] Zaniolo illegal sites where he could make online bets, on roulette or poker ... the organisers of the sites had told me that they would give me some advantages if I brought other bettors.\"\nA message about Zaniolo found on Fagioli's phone also said: \"Bravo, capture him, work for me.\"",

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "LONDON -- Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has said Christian Nørgaard \"could have broken my leg\" and should have been sent off for a late tackle in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Brentford.\nThe incident occurred in the 28th minute at Emirates Stadium, when Nørgaard scythed down Martinelli to stop the Gunners launching a counter-attack.\nThomas Partey later opened the scoring on 61 minutes before Yoann Wissa earned a point with a clever turn and finish 13 minutes later but the game was overshadowed by the Nørgaard tackle, which provoked an angry reaction from Martinelli.\nA source told ESPN that Nørgaard attempted to apologise in the tunnel at half-time but Martinelli waved away the midfielder.\nSpeaking about the tackle to Sky Sports, Martinelli said: \"I didn't see that again but in my opinion, in the moment if my foot was on the floor, he could break my leg.\n\"He said he didn't mean it. I believe him but still, you know? He could have broken my leg. For me, it was red. I need to see it again to be sure but for me it was nasty.\"\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank said in response: \"That is his opinion. I thought it was a strong yellow but it was a yellow.\"\nArsenal boss Mikel Arteta protested furiously on the touchline at the time and later said, \"I think my reaction tells everything.\"\nArteta also cast doubt over the availability of Ben White and Partey for Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal showdown against Real Madrid.\nThe Gunners travel to Spain aiming to back up a stunning 3-0 first-leg win on Wednesday as they bid to reach the semifinal stage for the first time since 2009.\nWhite missed Saturday's game after picking up a knock in training on Friday while Partey was substituted late on.\nArteta refused to specify the problem but said of Partey: \"He felt something so we didn't want to take any risks.\n\"We don't know [if he will be fit for Wednesday], I haven't spoken to the doctors yet. So they will check him now and see how he is.\"\nPushed again on White, Arteta said: \"Again, we don't know. So he could not be in condition to be in the squad today and be selected. So we have a few days but we'll have to wait and see.\"",

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "Hansi Flick celebrated Iñigo Martínez's incredible stoppage-time tackle as if it was a goal as Barcelona took another step towards the LaLiga title with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Leganés on Saturday.\nMartínez's challenge on the edge of the box prevented Munir El Haddadi from equalising in the 92nd minute after Jorge Sáenz's own goal had earlier given Barça the lead at Butarque.\nThe win extended Barça's unbeaten run to 24 games in all competitions and temporarily moved the LaLiga leaders seven points clear of Real Madrid, who play Alavés on Sunday.\n\"For me, the best situation [was] not only the goal, but the last save from Iñigo was unbelievable,\" Barça coach Flick said in the post-game news conference.\n\"I celebrated it like a goal. Everyone celebrated it as a goal. It's part of the game and, again, another clean sheet. It's the perfect match here.\n\"Three points are three points. It's fantastic. I am really happy and very proud of my team.\"\nBarça were far from their best against Leganés, who nearly took the lead early on when Adrià Altimira drew a smart save from Wojciech Szczęsny.\nThe only goal of the game came early in the second half, when Sáenz turned home Raphinha's cross.\nLeganés pushed for an equaliser late on, but Barça dug in and Flick was especially pleased with how his team battled in what was their sixth game in 16 days since the international break.\n\"Today, how we fight for 94, 95 minutes, it was unbelievable,\" the German added.\n\"When you see the load the players have in the last couple of weeks, after the international break ... what they did [in those games], the performances, it's unbelievable.\"\nThe win was tempered by losing left-back Alejandro Balde to injury in the first half.\nFlick said the Spain defender would undergo tests on Sunday to determine the severity of the knock.\nBarça return to action on Tuesday in the Champions League away at Borussia Dortmund. They travel to Germany with a 4-0 lead from the first leg of the quarterfinal tie.\nThe Blaugrana then have back-to-back home games in LaLiga against Celta Vigo and Mallorca, before a showdown with Madrid in the final of the Copa del Rey on April 26 in Seville.\n\"Now, we focus on recovery,\" Flick said. \"I think the word I use most is recovery, recovery, recovery.\n\"We will arrive back in the night in Barcelona, then [on Sunday] we recover and train with the other guys who didn't have so many minutes.\n\"And on Monday we fly to Dortmund. It's like that. We have no excuses. We focus on our job. The team is fantastic again, absolutely fantastic.\"",

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "Four Atlético Madrid fan groups have said they will take legal action against UEFA over Julián Álvarez's disallowed penalty in the club's Champions League round of 16 defeat to Real Madrid.\nÁlvarez's spot kick in the decisive shootout at the Metropolitano -- after the tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate -- was ruled out after a VAR review determined that the Argentina international had touched the ball with both feet, as Real triumphed 4-2 on penalties.\nThe fans commissioned an expert report which they say calls into question the video evidence released by UEFA in the aftermath of the game, which European football's governing body said demonstrated that Álvarez had touched the ball twice.\nIn a statement released on Friday, the groups -- Atlético's International Union of Fan Clubs as well as \"Senado Atletico,\" \"Los 50\" and \"Señales de Humo\" -- said they had decided to \"jointly commence legal proceedings against UEFA.\"\n\"It was agreed, as an initial measure, to create a working group made up of renowned, prestigious lawyers, who will be responsible for designing the appropriate legal strategy to file the relevant complaint as soon as possible,\" the statement said.\n\"We want to publicly thank fan groups, club members and fans for the support shown for the idea of defending the dignity and values which our club's history represents.\"\nReal beat Atlético 2-1 in the first leg of the round-of-16 tie at the Bernabéu on March 4.\nIn the second leg, Conor Gallagher's first-minute goal levelled the contest at 2-2.\nIn the subsequent shootout, Álvarez's penalty -- which he initially appeared to have converted -- was ruled out by VAR, deeming the forward to have slipped and touched the ball with both feet as he shot.\nAntonio Rüdiger then scored to win the shootout for Real, 4-2.\n\"Atlético Madrid consulted UEFA about the incident which led to Julián Álvarez's penalty being disallowed,\" UEFA said later in a statement. \"Although it was minimal, the player made contact with the ball with his supporting foot before shooting, as the video shows.\n\"Under the current rules, VAR had to call the referee to indicate that the goal should be ruled out. UEFA will initiate conversations with FIFA and IFAB to determine if the rules should be revised in cases where the double touch is clearly accidental.\"\nThe Atlético fan groups have questioned the video released by UEFA in support of that statement, saying that it had been edited.\nAtlético coach Diego Simeone reacted angrily to the decision to disallow the penalty, challenging journalists in his post-match news conference to \"raise their hands\" if they had seen the ball move, and later blaming UEFA for eliminating his team from the Champions League.",

On that occasion, he was absent due to testing positive for COVID-19.\nNewcastle are seventh ahead of Sunday's match, while United -- led by Ruben Amorim -- are 13th.

Join us for the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip from around the globe.\nTransfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades\n- Reports: USMNT's McKennie in gambling probe\n- Ancelotti: Madrid 'slump' a team issue, not Vini's\n- Man United legend Cantona: Ratcliffe ripping 'soul' out\n- Manchester United are leading the chase to sign Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki, despite interest from Liverpool, reports The Mirror. A move for the 21-year-old would be worth £20 million, and they saw the Frenchman up close as he scored the late equaliser in the first leg of their UEFA Europa League quarterfinal.\n- Chelsea are willing to offer £50m plus a player to re-sign Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guéhi, reports The Mirror. The Eagles want £70m for their captain and would be willing to accept defender Trevoh Chalobah as part of the deal, with the Blues valuing the 25-year-old at £30m. It is reported that Palace are resigned to losing Guéhi, who Liverpool and Newcastle United have also been interested in.\n- Arsenal are keeping a close eye on RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Šeško as they prepare for the summer transfer window, reports TEAMtalk. The 21-year-old has a €70m release clause that could increase based on his performances, which the Gunners are willing to match if conversations continue positively.\n- Chelsea have joined the race to sign Angers goalkeeper Yahia Fofana, reports Football Insider. Premier League clubs such as Newcastle United, Brentford, and Wolverhampton Wanderers have also reportedly scouted the 24-year-old. This comes after Didier Drogba recommended the Ivorian to his former club, having been impressed by his form for club and country over the last year.\n- Borussia Dortmund are weighing up a move to sign Arsenal left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko in the summer, reports Football Insider. The Bundesliga club have been long-term admirers of the 28-year-old, and both Arsenal and Zinchenko are open to parting ways, with the Ukraine international having lost his starting spot to Myles Lewis-Skelly.",

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "You've seen your favorite soccer players on the pitch, but what about in action figure form? It's the latest trend working its way around social media: with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI), people are turning themselves into boxed action figures by including accessories that showcase their personality.\nWe wondered what some of the world's best soccer players would look like, so decided to ask ChatGPT and added accessories connected to their career based on where they played and what they have won, among other things.\nFrom Lionel Messi to Aitana Bonmatí, here are some of the world's best as soccer's G.I. Joes or Barbie dolls.\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has done it all, making it impossible to include everything he has achieved into a single package.\nThat said, we have included the legendary No. 10 with his very own Argentina flag, Inter Miami emblem (though don't look too closely at the words or symbol) and the World Cup trophy, which he won in 2022, as well as a cup of his favorite traditional South American drink: maté.\nClosing in on 1,000 professional goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has had a legendary career spanning two decades. For his action figure, the Portugal superstar gets his very own UEFA Champions League trophy (like the five he's won during his career), a Portugal flag that has made him the most famous name in the Iberian country, and, of course, his very own soccer balls.\nThough AI might have got a bit confused which Ronaldo's face we input... as there's definitely more of the retired Brazilian one than his chiseled jawline.\nThe Brazilian winger has enchanted crowds with his goals, tricks, and iconic moments and is one of the best players of his generation.\nAlways true to his roots, Neymar gets his own Santos emblem now he's back in his homeland, the Champions League trophy he won with Barcelona, and the Olympic gold medal he picked up on home soil in 2016.\nOne of the world's best players, Mbappé first came through at AS Monaco, became a superstar at Paris Saint-Germain, and is now plying his trade at Real Madrid. As a star for France, he also gets the World Cup trophy he won in 2018.\nThe 26-year-old also gets his very own \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" mask, which pays homage to a nickname that has followed him around during his career. We're not quite sure why he looks so grumpy though.\nHaaland has been frightening the world's best defenses since moving to Man City and has become one of the best players in the world in a short amount of time.\nAs Norway's star player he gets a flag, but also his own Premier League and Champions League trophy, which he won in Hanchester [sic] City's legendary treble-winning season in 2023-24. The detail on City's badge is also... erm... interesting given it's meant to be a ship and a red rose.\nIt's hard to believe that Yamal has become a bona-fide superstar at just 17 years old, and is already one of the world's best players.\nHe made a name for himself in Spain's Euro 2024-winning side, but has also cemented his place for Barcelona -- which is presumably why he gets two badges. His youthful persona and social media presence has also made him recognizable among a new generation, which sees the teenager get his own cell phone and sunglasses.\nFresh off signing his new contract for the Reds, the Egypt winger is here to stay at Liverpool and the club will delighted that his current action figure has no mention of any clubs from Saudi Arabia yet.\nWinning the Champions League and Premier League has made him a legend at Anfield forever, but Reds' fans might take issue as to what AI has done to the famed Liver bird, while Egyptian supporters might want to look away from what is supposed to be the Eagle of Saladin.\nOne of the best wingers in the world, Saka is on his way to becoming an Arsenal icon, having come through the club's academy, but doesn't have a host of trophies (beyond one FA Cup) to fill out his action-figure box yet.\nIt surely won't be long before the England international adds something bigger and, at 23, \"Starboy\" has time on his side -- though AI has made him look about 10 years old!\nA legend at Tottenham and now plying his trade at Bayern Munich in Germany, Kane loves scoring goals and has shown why he is one of the world's best strikers in two different leagues.\nHaving played for Spurs for so long, it's no surprise there's not many trophies to add to his box, so we'll assume it's a simple typo and nothing more targeted that the club badge reads Tottenham \"Notspur.\"\nGiven his nickname is \"Captain America,\" as captain of the USMNT side, Pulisic is perhaps the most obvious choice for a soccer player to already have their own action figure.\nThe 26-year-old has already had a busy club career -- with Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and now AC Milan, and has a Champions League and UEFA Super Cup to display. Although, wouldn't a World Cup trophy look nice in that set?\nAlso: anyone else impressed that AI managed to get the right numbers of stars and stripes in the U.S. flag?\nThe best women's player in the world, Bonmatí achieved a rare feat by winning every major club and individual award available to a European player back in 2023. Thus, the huge collection of awards is shown in the Spain midfielder's set, including her Ballon d'Or, Champions League and World Cup trophy.\nSadly, she appears to play for ECB, rather than Barcelona, which is odd as AI got it right for Yamal above.\nOne of the best defenders in the world and fresh off her world-record move to Women's Super League champions Chelsea [not Chelsea Foutball Clud], Girma has made herself a household name with her performances for the USWNT and is credited with her very own Olympic gold medal from 2024.\nOddly, her USA flag only has 41 stars, so we're not sure what happened to the other nine states.\nAnd finally, we have one of the best rising stars in the sport, who is starting to get more popular with what she's bringing for Washington Spirit in NWSL and internationally with the USWNT [not, you'll be surprised to learn, the LSP.]\nRodman is only 22, hence the inclusion of an iPhone, but her honors include an NWSL championship and Olympic gold medal. Also, who wouldn't want a pink-haired soccer action figure?",
