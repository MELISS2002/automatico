        "title": "Star exits, coaching changes, lawsuits: After awful 2024, San Diego is rebounding",
        "date": "2025-04-11",
        "content": "Still reassessing and rebuilding the remnants left from a stormy 2024, new San Diego Wave coach Jonas Eidevall was honest after suffering his first loss in the NWSL.\n\"Like I said before the season, I think we need to have a really developing mentality. We need to grow stronger every week physically, technically, mentally, and this is no exception to that,\" Eidevall told ESPN following a 2-1 away defeat against defending champions Orlando Pride on Mar. 29.\n\"We know that: that's the story, that's the journey of our season here. We have lots of things left to develop, to grow and mature into, that's natural for us where we are at.\"\nHired in January, the former Arsenal coach is one of many fresh faces who have stepped into the organization that is seeking to move beyond the nightmares of the previous campaign. On and off the field, last year was a disaster for the 2023 NWSL Shield winners that were once one of the vanguards of the league. Through a rebuild with new owners, staff, and players, San Diego are hoping to leave behind the rocky waters of 2024 and find familiar sunny skies in a new spring.\nAnd despite that latest loss on the pitch, there is reason to feel optimism.\nTo the credit of Eidevall and his squad, it was easy to spot a number of silver linings from the latest narrow defeat that featured a majority of the possession, a clear style of play, and standout moments for promising young players. Coupled with a win and draw in their two previous matches to kick off 2025, the Wave appear to be on the cusp of a turnaround. Nevertheless, it's far too early to make assumptions about how things will go for the team after just 270+ minutes of play.\nWith plenty still to prove on the pitch and beyond, can San Diego get back on track?\n\"It was a tough year for the club, there's no kind of sugar coating that,\" sporting director and general manager Camille Ashton told ESPN about 2024. \"This is a club that has always had a lot of ambition and expectations to do well and be successful.\"\nMonths after finishing at the top of the table in 2023, San Diego endured a disastrous season that involved three different managers (Casey Stoney, Paul Buckle, Landon Donovan) and a 10th-place finish, which left them outside the playoff picture. Key figures and U.S. women's national team stars such as Naomi Girma and Jaedyn Shaw headed for the exits, eventually leaving the club (for Chelsea and North Carolina Courage respectively) after the conclusion of 2024.\n\"On the field, that's always tough to get out there and cheer all the time, to get as excited as you want to be when the team isn't coming through the way that you're trying to will them to be,\" said Sean Dreusike, a member of the Sirens supporters group.\nBehind the scenes, the team also made negative headlines after former employees sued the club and the NWSL, citing allegations of discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The suit followed accusations in the summer that president Jill Ellis, who has since left after being hired by FIFA, had led a toxic workplace environment.\nBy January, a sixth former employee also joined the lawsuit, alleging sexual harassment by a male supervisor at the time.\n\"The off field stuff, being a fan, leaves questions that need to be answered by the team and fans are some of the right people along with media and whatnot to ask those questions and try to get either answers or change,\" said Dreusike. The Sirens released a statement in October in which the group announced they \"no longer trust the front office's decision-making nor do we believe in the current leadership's ability to oversee the positive changes that are desperately needed.\"\nAs part of broader front office alterations, Ellis' December exit marked a significant pivot in direction for the Wave, as did the completed purchase of the club late last year by the Levine Leichtman family.\nLooking back on the pitch, Ashton, who was hired last summer, was tasked with rebuilding the squad that not only had Girma and Shaw soon heading out the door, but also superstar Alex Morgan hanging up her boots in September.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

Bringing in Eidevall. According to Ashton, the Swedish coach won over the Wave due to his tactical knowledge, ability to win titles, experience in a high-pressure league in England, know-how with building teams, and ambition. Importantly, there was a sense he could translate those skills into the NWSL and create sustainability with the Wave.\nFor goalkeeper and captain Kailen Sheridan, the hiring of Eidevall and his staff was the most vital piece of the team's new puzzle for 2025.\n\"The coaching change is going to be huge,\" Sheridan told ESPN during the preseason when asked which modification at the club will be the most impactful. \"It's a complete new staff, which kind of is an opportunity to start over. Obviously, players is massive as well, but with the coaching change, that's a whole tactical change.\"\n\"If we had some staff that stayed with us [from 2024], the players obviously would be a big difference. They would have to come in and adapt to the style. But now we're starting with a new style, so it's an opportunity for the staff to kind of make their mark, and the players to learn and to grow together.\"\nPart of that process has also meant reinforcing the roster. Along with a list of intriguing up-and-coming names, ownership hasn't wasted time with the incorporation of noteworthy figures like France international Kenza Dali, Canada international Adriana Leon, and Colombia international Daniela Arias.\nAnother key aspect of Eidevall in this rebuild is his ability to influence the players with a move to San Diego. Dali, recently with Aston Villa, wasn't sure at first if she wanted to leave England, but was swayed after a conversation with the coach.\n\"I had a call with Jonas. I know Jonas, I played against him a lot,\" Dali told ESPN. \"I know what he is trying to do in terms of football, and that's what really attracted me is the way he plays, his philosophy. That was [what] convinced me.\"\nWith reinforcements in tow and new players from last season stepping up, the change in the starting XI from the season openers in 2024 and 2025 was a dramatic one. Of the XI that took the field for last season's first game, only three returned to the starting lineup for 2025's opener.\nLooking back at the old formation, it's impossible to miss marquee stars and leaders such as Girma and Morgan. And while it's near-impossible to replace what some of those names represented beyond the confines of Snapdragon Stadium, the Wave's latest additions have notably boosted the team this season.\n\"Those players [who left] obviously leave their mark and I think they're the type of players where you feel when they're gone,\" midfielder Makenzy Robbe told ESPN. \"But I think at the same time we've really been able to kind of keep the intensity and the standard high.\"\nIt's a small sample size, but the underlying numbers look decent for the team that has kicked the season off with a 1W-1D-1L record that has included just one match at home. With the aim of dominating the ball and building out from the back, the team has averaged 57.3% possession per game, creating 18 chances along the way, scoring five times, and accumulating a total xG of 3.59. When regaining the ball, they're currently averaging a success rate of 56% in tackles.\nAgainst Orlando, in what Eidevall claimed to be his biggest challenge to date with the team, there was much to like from the squad that was at first able to keep the title-holders silent. Through a high press and using possession as the best form of defense, the Wave appeared ready to snap Orlando's 21-game unbeaten streak at home.\n\"There [are] a lot of things in our performance we can be pleased with and I think we can be a little bit angry and irritated that we don't get any points away with us from this game,\" said Eidevall post-game.\nAli Krieger and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights from women's soccer in the Americas. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nBy the second half, Orlando figured out the San Diego press and were given a lifeline through a goal in the 50th minute from Haley McCutcheon off a corner. Although youthful substitutions helped level things out for the Wave, with a goal from 19-year-old Chiamaka Okwuchukwu less than two minutes into her debut, Orlando would eventually take back the lead with a dramatic game-winning penalty from Marta in the 76th minute.\nSoft penalty or not, which was retaken due to Sheridan stepping off her line, the reality of the match was that Orlando's second-half tactical changes helped wrestle back the momentum San Diego once had. Indicative of how Eidevall's side is still a work in progress, the result also marked the second match in a row in which the Wave ran into obstacles after half-time.\nIt's far from perfect soccer, but Eidevall's willingness to maintain his possession-heavy style of play -- especially against the reigning champions -- was a commendable decision. With teenage prospects like Melanie Barcenas, Kimmi Ascanio, and Okwuchukwu putting on a show once coming off the bench, there's also reason to feel hopeful that the club already has the next generation of game-changers in the mix.\n\"I'm pleased with the mentality that we have in the squad. [Chiamaka] is a great example of that,\" said Eidevall post-game. \"Haven't being fielded at all for the first two games, now she had a good opportunity coming in here for the third. I definitely think that we have a lot of good players in the squad. We have healthy competition and I'm really pleased with a lot of players' contributions at the moment.\"\nUSWNT's Jaedyn Shaw discusses dealing with expectations following her move to North Carolina Courage from San Diego Wave.\nWhether those contributions include more minutes for prospects, the next step for Eidevall & Co. is finding the right balance for a roster that's struggled in the second halves of games. Of course, that's only the sporting aspect of the new era for the Wave.\nBehind the scenes and in the front office, there's nothing that has yet to bring negative attention in 2025, but it's still incumbent on the organization to learn from last season and prove to their supporters that they can be trusted once again. Given that Eidevall, Ashton and others represent the start of a different era, there's an opportunity to showcase that the detrimental problems of the past won't return, and doing so will only benefit the sporting side for the former Shield-holders, who are eager for much more than just a regular season trophy.\n\"Expectations for us, we wanna be competing in [the playoffs of] November this year. That's something that I think everyone across the organization would say and feel strongly about. So for us, that's our goal,\" said Ashton.\n\"It's constantly evolving and growing and trying to get better and that's on and off the field here.\"",

Bukayo [Saka] said, 'If you feel it, go for it.' I looked at the wall and the keeper and thought, 'I can bend this around the outside.\"\nAnd Arteta has backed Rice's decision, saying it showed the qualities needed at the top level.\n\"I love it, especially when it goes to the back of the net instead of a counter-attack,\" he said. \"They have to make the decision, we are here to help them, to try to paint the picture of what the options are, but I loved it.\n\"I think when we talk about making the next step, it's a lot about that. It's about taking initiative, making things happen on the pitch and believing that you can actually win the game by yourself sometimes, and I was really impressed the way he did it.\"\nThanks to Rice's goals, and a third from Mikel Merino, Arsenal find themselves in prime position to make the semifinals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009.\n\"I mean there's no coincidence that all the top teams you look at the games in the Champions League the amount of individual moments that won the football matches,\" Arteta added.\n\"In the Champions League at this level that's a necessity, without that I don't think you have a chance to progress and be in the finals and winning trophies like we want.\"\nArsenal host Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday as they look to narrow an 11-poiont gap to leaders Liverpool, before visiting Madrid for the second leg of their Champions League quarterfinal on Wednesday.",

        "content": "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract at Anfield, ending a monthslong saga over the Egypt international's future with the Merseyside club.\nSalah, whose previous deal was set to expire this summer, had repeatedly suggested that this could be his final season at Liverpool. However, the 32-year-old has now committed himself to Arne Slot's side, signing a two-year deal that will keep him at the club until at least 2027.\nDiscussions have been taking place for several months, with sporting director Richard Hughes overseeing negotiations with Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa.\nRecent reports had suggested Salah -- who is Liverpool's highest-paid player -- had agreed to reduce his salary in order to remain at Anfield; however, a source told ESPN that a pay cut was never on the agenda for either party.\n\"Of course I'm very excited,\" he said. \"We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.\n\"It's great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it's going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.\n\"I would like to say to [the fans], I am very, very happy to be here. I signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we'll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we're going to win more trophies.\"\nSalah joined Liverpool from Roma in summer 2017 and has since cemented himself as one of the best forwards in world football.\nHe has made close to 400 appearances for the club, winning seven major honors, including the Premier League and Champions League. This season, Salah has scored 32 goals in 45 appearances in all competitions -- including 27 Premier League goals.\nSalah has been the driving force behind Liverpool's pursuit of the club's 20th league title this term. His brace in the win over Southampton in March took him to third on the club's all-time scorers list.\nHe becomes the first of Liverpool's three out-of-contract players to sign a new deal, with the futures of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold still uncertain.\nLiverpool captain Van Dijk is also expected to commit to a new deal at Anfield, with the defender revealing last week that \"progress\" had been made in negations.",

Join us for the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip from around the globe.\nTransfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades\n- Postecoglou: 'Someone is leaking Tottenham team news'\n- Salah signs contract extension at Liverpool\n- Man United legend Cantona: Sir Jim Ratcliffe ripping 'soul' out\n- Arsenal are a \"concrete option\" for Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman, who is expected to leave Germany this summer, according to Sky Germany. The 28-year-old, who is also wanted by clubs in Saudi Arabia, has internally expressed his desire to leave Bayern as game time has been hard to come by this season. Tottenham are also keen on signing Coman, but are currently in a \"waiting position\" due to the Frenchman's high salary. Meanwhile, his Bayern teammate Leroy Sané looks set to stay at the Bundesliga club for another season at least, as contract extension talks progress.\n- Manchester United could let several star players leave the club at the end of the season to fund a move for Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha, the Daily Mail reports. The likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all at risk of being let go permanently once they return from their respective loan spells. Cunha has a release clause of £62.5m, which has put several Premier League clubs on high alert. According to the Mail, Rasmus Højlund and Alejandro Garnacho could also be moved on by Man United if the right bid comes in this summer.\n- Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyökeres and Moise Kean are all on Bayern Munich's striker shortlist, Christian Falk has reported. Club execs are looking to sign a young back-up option to Harry Kane once Mathys Tel's long-term future is resolved. The forward has spent the second half of the season on loan at Tottenham, but has hardly set the Premier League alight during his short stay. Mainz attacker Jonathan Burkhardt is also an option for Bayern, although his injury record remains a concern internally.\n- Clubs from the Bundesliga could rival Newcastle United for Liverpool defender Jarell Quansah, Fabrizio Romano reports. The young centre-back is facing the prospect of another season playing behind Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk, following news on Friday that the Liverpool captain is close to signing a new contract with the club. As such, several Bundesliga sides are said to be monitoring the situation and could enter the race to sign Quansah if the 22-year-old intimates his desire to leave Anfield in the summer.\n- Everton are hoping they can win the race to sign Feyenoord defender Dávid Hancko this summer, as per Football Insider. With the allure of a new stadium and the backing of the Friedkin ownership group, the club are plotting a \"transformational\" off-season. Hancko is regarded as an \"ambitious\" target by Everton, as the Slovakian centre-back is also wanted by Juventus, Chelsea and Tottenham.",
