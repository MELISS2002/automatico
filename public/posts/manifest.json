        "content": "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has praised Declan Rice after the midfielder revealed that he ignored the advice of the club's set-piece coach before scoring the first of two sensational free kicks against Real Madrid on Tuesday.\nThe England international's first-ever goals direct from free kicks led Arsenal to a 3-0 win over Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Emirates Stadium.\nAfter the game, Rice said that Arsenal's set-piece coach Nicolas Jover was instructing him to cross the ball.\n\"It didn't make sense,\" said Rice. \"I'm happy I took it. Bukayo [Saka] said, 'If you feel it, go for it.' I looked at the wall and the keeper and thought, 'I can bend this around the outside.\"\nAnd Arteta has backed Rice's decision, saying it showed the qualities needed at the top level.\n\"I love it, especially when it goes to the back of the net instead of a counter-attack,\" he said. \"They have to make the decision, we are here to help them, to try to paint the picture of what the options are, but I loved it.\n\"I think when we talk about making the next step, it's a lot about that. It's about taking initiative, making things happen on the pitch and believing that you can actually win the game by yourself sometimes, and I was really impressed the way he did it.\"\nThanks to Rice's goals, and a third from Mikel Merino, Arsenal find themselves in prime position to make the semifinals of the Champions League for the first time since 2009.\n\"I mean there's no coincidence that all the top teams you look at the games in the Champions League the amount of individual moments that won the football matches,\" Arteta added.\n\"In the Champions League at this level that's a necessity, without that I don't think you have a chance to progress and be in the finals and winning trophies like we want.\"\nArsenal host Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday as they look to narrow an 11-poiont gap to leaders Liverpool, before visiting Madrid for the second leg of their Champions League quarterfinal on Wednesday.",

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract at Anfield, ending a monthslong saga over the Egypt international's future with the Merseyside club.\nSalah, whose previous deal was set to expire this summer, had repeatedly suggested that this could be his final season at Liverpool. However, the 32-year-old has now committed himself to Arne Slot's side, signing a two-year deal that will keep him at the club until at least 2027.\nDiscussions have been taking place for several months, with sporting director Richard Hughes overseeing negotiations with Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa.\nRecent reports had suggested Salah -- who is Liverpool's highest-paid player -- had agreed to reduce his salary in order to remain at Anfield; however, a source told ESPN that a pay cut was never on the agenda for either party.\n\"Of course I'm very excited,\" he said. \"We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football.\n\"It's great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it's going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career.\n\"I would like to say to [the fans], I am very, very happy to be here. I signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we'll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we're going to win more trophies.\"\nSalah joined Liverpool from Roma in summer 2017 and has since cemented himself as one of the best forwards in world football.\nHe has made close to 400 appearances for the club, winning seven major honors, including the Premier League and Champions League. This season, Salah has scored 32 goals in 45 appearances in all competitions -- including 27 Premier League goals.\nSalah has been the driving force behind Liverpool's pursuit of the club's 20th league title this term. His brace in the win over Southampton in March took him to third on the club's all-time scorers list.\nHe becomes the first of Liverpool's three out-of-contract players to sign a new deal, with the futures of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold still uncertain.\nLiverpool captain Van Dijk is also expected to commit to a new deal at Anfield, with the defender revealing last week that \"progress\" had been made in negations.",

        "content": "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has said that Liam Delap can become a \"top player\" but insists that the club's ideal transfer target is a \"copy\" of their current No. 9 Nicolas Jackson.\nSources have told ESPN that Chelsea face competition from Manchester United to sign Delap this summer and that he could be available for £40 million ($52m) if Ipswich Town are relegated.\nMaresca, who previously worked with Delap at Manchester City's academy, said the England youth international will be an \"enemy\" this Sunday when Chelsea host Ipswich, but still praised his qualities.\n\"In terms of numbers, he's doing fantastic,\" Maresca said. \"It's not just in terms of his numbers. The way he plays and fights and is always 'there.' But he's an Ipswich player. He's an enemy on Sunday because we need to beat them, and then after the game I wish him all the best for the future.\n\"He's already very good. I know Liam from five, six years ago. He can be a top player, it all depends on him.\"\nDelap has scored 12 times in his maiden Premier League season after joining Ipswich from City, and Chelsea have struggled for goals since Jackson's injury at the start of February.\nBut while Chelsea have long been linked with a move for a striker, Maresca -- when discussing Delap's style -- reaffirmed his faith in Jackson, who has nine goals this league campaign.\n\"To compare Liam [Delap] with Harry Kane and Erling Haaland, I think it's a bit early,\" Maresca said. \"But for sure, in terms of style he's that kind of player.

        "title": "After Salah's contract, where do Liverpool now need to improve?",
        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "If Liverpool's narrow derby victory over Everton last week had some supporters reaching for the champagne, Sunday's shock 3-2 defeat away to Fulham in the Premier League ensured that, for now, it remains firmly on ice.\nThough second-placed Arsenal's drab 1-1 draw with Everton on Saturday diminished the impact of Liverpool's second league defeat of the season, the error-strewn display at Craven Cottage served as a sobering reminder that, while the runaway leaders have one hand on the trophy, there is still work to do.\nArne Slot's side are 11 points clear at the summit and, with just seven games left to play, it would take an unprecedented collapse for them to surrender the title from here. But while it's testament to the strength of Liverpool's overall body of work that they boast such a commanding lead, their aura of infallibility has undeniably been dented in recent weeks. Sunday's loss in the capital marked a third defeat in four games in all competitions.\nThe fact that one of those defeats came via a penalty shootout against an impressive Paris Saint-Germain side in the Champions League and another against a Newcastle United team vying to end their club's 70-year trophy drought in the Carabao Cup final offers some mitigation.\nLiverpool were unlucky against PSG and, after an energy-sapping 120 minutes, struggled to match Newcastle's hunger and tenacity a few days later. Against Fulham, though, Liverpool were the architects of their own downfall. They conceded three goals in the space of 14 first-half minutes, after taking an early lead through Alexis Mac Allister's wonder strike, before Luis Díaz got one back in the second half.\n\"I think there is no reason for us to be complacent,\" Slot in his news conference afterward. \"We are not No. 1 at the moment because we win every game with a margin of three or four goals ... That's not the way it is for us, so we are fully aware of the fact we have to compete for seven more games.\"\nSlot and his players may be just a handful of games away from cementing their place in the annals of Liverpool history, but the coming weeks promise to be instructive, both in terms of shaping the wider narrative around their campaign and dictating whose position might be under threat at Anfield next season.\nLiverpool have had an exceptional season, but recent results have given credence to the view in some quarters that the team are far from the finished article. After losing just one game in 27 in all competitions before January, Slot's side have been beaten six times in 22 since the turn of the year, although two of those defeats (away to PSV Eindhoven in the league phase of the Champions League and Tottenham Hotspur in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semifinals) ultimately proved of little consequence.\nFatigue has been mooted as one potential reason for Liverpool's drop-off, though Slot dismissed this suggestion after the loss at Craven Cottage. According to Opta, only 10 outfield players in the Premier League have started all 31 games this season, three of whom play for Liverpool: Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Ryan Gravenberch.\nDan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\nFor Gravenberch, in particular, there is some weight to the argument that an increased workload has taken its toll in recent weeks. The 22-year-old has played 2,657 minutes in the league, more than double the 1,120 he clocked up in 2023-24. That his midfielder deputy, Wataru Endo, has yet to start a league game is reflective of Slot's tendency to rely on a relatively small crop of players.\nWhile it might be too simplistic to blame weary legs for Liverpool's downturn in form, a degree of mental fatigue seems to have crept in for some. After all, barring the lesser-spotted Federico Chiesa, this is the same group of players who saw their season implode in spectacular fashion under Jurgen Klopp a year ago. Perhaps some of the calamitous individual errors against Fulham were born from a bout of end-of-season nerves. If so, this is something Slot and his players must nip in the bud quickly, as they can't afford to let the ghosts of last season return to haunt them in the coming weeks.\nIt is also no coincidence that Liverpool's dip has coincided with a rare barren spell in front of goal for Salah. The Egypt international has enjoyed one of the great individual Premier League seasons, registering a mightily impressive 27 goals and 17 assists, and has contributed to a whopping 61% of Liverpool's 72 league goals. But he has gone without scoring in his last four games in all competitions and his last league goals were a brace of penalties against strugglers Southampton in early March.\nWhile Diogo Jota scored a fine winner in the Merseyside derby and Díaz was impactful as a substitute against Fulham, Liverpool's attacking play is far less convincing when Salah's influence wanes. Slot must hope his talisman is able to get back to his best between now and the end of the campaign.\nBeth Lindop predicts a busy transfer window for Liverpool, and says Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez would be a signing that makes a lot of sense.\nDespite Liverpool having dominated in the Premier League, this summer promises to be one of the busiest in years at Anfield.\nThe first, and perhaps most important piece of business has been done with Salah signing a new contract, ending a months-long saga over his future. Next, Liverpool must establish the futures of their other out-of-contract stars: Van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold. While a source has told ESPN that Real Madrid are confident of landing Alexander-Arnold on a free transfer, there remains optimism on Merseyside that Van Dijk will commit.\nAssuming that's how the situation plays out, Liverpool will need to dip into the market for a right-back to provide competition for the 21-year-old Conor Bradley. The Northern Ireland international has proved a capable deputy for Alexander-Arnold since his breakthrough last season and has the quality to establish himself as Slot's first choice. But his injury record -- coupled with a lack of experience at elite level -- means it would be a risk not to bolster that position.\nOn the opposite flank, the need to freshen up at left-back is glaring. Andrew Robertson has been a tremendous servant for the club since joining for £8 million from Hull City in 2017, but he has struggled for form this term. The Scotland captain's catalogue of errors in the buildup to Fulham's second goal were emblematic of his difficult campaign, while back-up Kostas Tsimikas is not viewed as a long-term solution and may be tempted to leave in search of regular minutes.\nAFC Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez has been heavily linked with a £40m move to Anfield and, at 21, aligns well with Liverpool's traditional recruitment policy of signing young players who already have a significant wealth of high-level experience. Ajax defender Jorrel Hato, 19, also fits that profile and is capable of playing as both a full-back and a central defender, while his transfer is valued at around £30m.\nJames Olley debates where Harry Kane could end up if he leaves Bayern Munich.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Liverpool's forward line is also in need of surgery. Darwin Núñez has endured another turbulent campaign and, after three seasons at Anfield, looks no closer to developing into the prolific No. 9 the club hoped he would become when they spent an initial £64m to sign him from Benfica in the summer of 2022.\nJota is a more natural goal scorer, but he too has looked some way off his best this season and his continued injury struggles often leave Liverpool in need of someone to take up the mantle as first-choice center forward. Of course, Slot's side will not be the only team in the market for a striker, and the likes of Newcastle's Alexander Isak, Napoli's Victor Osimhen (on loan at Galatasaray) and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko will come at a premium of between £70m-£150m. But they might be able to recoup some money from the possible exit of Núñez to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere.\nWhile the club are unlikely to sign more than three or four new players, it would be shrewd for Liverpool to recruit a midfielder to help lighten the load on Gravenberch. And the Reds have not signed a center-back since Ibrahima Konaté in 2021, so could benefit from a reshuffle there too, even if Van Dijk stays on.\nConsidering this squad is likely to be crowned champions of England in the not-too-distant future, it's clear there is still plenty of room for improvement. For now, though, Liverpool's focus must be on returning to winning ways -- starting with this weekend's visit of West Ham United to Anfield. Anything less than three points against Graham Potter's side and there will be concerns that the Reds' slight malaise is descending into a mini-crisis which could leave scars that even a summer of good transfer business can't fix.",

The 28-year-old, who is also wanted by clubs in Saudi Arabia, has internally expressed his desire to leave Bayern as game time has been hard to come by this season. Tottenham are also keen on signing Coman, but are currently in a \"waiting position\" due to the Frenchman's high salary. Meanwhile, his Bayern teammate Leroy Sané looks set to stay at the Bundesliga club for another season at least, as contract extension talks progress.\n- Manchester United could let several star players leave the club at the end of the season to fund a move for Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha, the Daily Mail reports. The likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all at risk of being let go permanently once they return from their respective loan spells. Cunha has a release clause of £62.5m, which has put several Premier League clubs on high alert. According to the Mail, Rasmus Højlund and Alejandro Garnacho could also be moved on by Man United if the right bid comes in this summer.\n- Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyökeres and Moise Kean are all on Bayern Munich's striker shortlist, Christian Falk has reported. Club execs are looking to sign a young back-up option to Harry Kane once Mathys Tel's long-term future is resolved. The forward has spent the second half of the season on loan at Tottenham, but has hardly set the Premier League alight during his short stay. Mainz attacker Jonathan Burkhardt is also an option for Bayern, although his injury record remains a concern internally.\n- Clubs from the Bundesliga could rival Newcastle United for Liverpool defender Jarell Quansah, Fabrizio Romano reports. The young centre-back is facing the prospect of another season playing behind Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk, following news on Friday that the Liverpool captain is close to signing a new contract with the club. As such, several Bundesliga sides are said to be monitoring the situation and could enter the race to sign Quansah if the 22-year-old intimates his desire to leave Anfield in the summer.\n- Everton are hoping they can win the race to sign Feyenoord defender Dávid Hancko this summer, as per Football Insider. With the allure of a new stadium and the backing of the Friedkin ownership group, the club are plotting a \"transformational\" off-season. Hancko is regarded as an \"ambitious\" target by Everton, as the Slovakian centre-back is also wanted by Juventus, Chelsea and Tottenham.",
